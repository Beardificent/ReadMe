# MAKING A README

We've been told that a good project starts with a good readme,
so that's what we're trying here, trying to see if we grasp the concept.

## HOW TO MAKE ONE YOURSELF.

You can create a readme -which is a plain text file- via your local folders and add a new text file or via the terminal. 


### WHAT DO YOU NEED

A computer at your disposal with access to terminal or a text editor.

```
Notepad
notion.so
PHPSTORM
```

### CREATING A READ ME

A step by step series of examples on how to get it working.

```
Open terminal
touch command + name of file .txt
```

To add words in terminal

```
Echo command "text" >name of file .txt
```
